# Embed an iframe with a web map link

Markdown can take pure html. So just add an iframe html element to it.

## Code to embed in an iframe element

Here is the code as written in the source markdown document:

```
<iframe width="1200" height="800" frameborder="1" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=6b6a075eca8d4899958fb273710a6806"></iframe>
```

<iframe width="1200" height="800" frameborder="1" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=6b6a075eca8d4899958fb273710a6806"></iframe>


## Analysis

It should just work. All markdown to html converters can handle it, as it's part of the markdown spec. And that's all.
